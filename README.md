Codes to use with xcompact3D for pre-processing and post-processing of airfoils.

Preprocess_code_nc0018.py 
-> Has all the tools to pre-process the airfoil. it meshes the airfoil ,defines the domain, probes, etc.




NACA0018_Solid_Post_0dg_GITHUBv1/

-> Has the directory used for the calculations shown in the thesis. The structure of the directory must not be altered 
to achieve a good usage of the codes. Inside results_data should be all the .dat files generated by the post-processing code.
From this directory the .dat files will be read to process all the 2D plots.

  -plot_forces_compare.py
    -> Has all the tools to post-process and analyze the convergence of the CL and Cd.
      it does a moving average and a standard deviation for each average obtained.

 -plot_probes_u.py
    -> Code to post-process the monitoring probes only for velocity variables.

 -plot_vel_profiles
   -> Code to plot the velocity profiles extracted from the mean field.

 -plot_anergy_exergy.py
   -> Code to plot the energy/exergy results and decomposition of forces through energy approach.

- data/
  directory with the results in the last timestep for the simulation with the NACA0018 at 0Â° of AoA.
